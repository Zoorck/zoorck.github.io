I"<p>I’m Marc Serra, a <em>almost-self-taught programmer</em>. My goal is to feel comfortable enough to be self proclaimed a full-stack developer.  I’ve been playing with Python because of my background, I’m a physicist. Django Framework, Pandas Library, Scrappy, Numpy, … are some of my best known trip friends now.</p>

<p>I’ve also been playing around with some JS basic skills, some AWS, docker, jekyll ;), HTML, CSS, SQL, php, and some other stuff that I’ll be sharing right here in my blog and on my GitHub.</p>

<p>I hope you find interesting info in my bog and guides for your personal leaning. I also expect this to be my open source lab for good inventions and also a recap of my failures. It’s always useful to remember what went wrong at the beginning.</p>
