I"ý<p>Iâ€™m Marc Serra self-taught programmer. My goal is to feel comfortable enough to be self proclaimed a full-stack developer.  Iâ€™ve been playing with Python because of my background, Iâ€™m a physicist. Django Framework, Pandas Library, Scrappy, Numpy, â€¦ are some of my best known trip friends now.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also been playing around with some JS basic skills, some AWS, docker, jekyll ;), HTML, CSS, SQL, php, and some other stuff that Iâ€™ll be sharing right here in my blog and on my GitHub.</p>
