I"ä<p>First impressions are important. So I think that my web doesnâ€™t have a good start (home page). Thatâ€™s basically due to the fact that it only says â€œHello world!â€. Iâ€™ve managed to go from this:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/old_look2.JPG" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>to this:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/newlook2.JPG" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-mountains-under-cloudy-sky-3022417/">this</a>! So thank you very much <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@tomas-malco-malik-793526">TomÃ¡Å¡ MalÄo</a></p>

<p>And also had to work out some css like this small trim:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/banner_css.JPG" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>It looks like .jpg is key sensitive when related to a css img file but not in a blogâ€¦ sounds quite weird to me but it is working now and it wasnâ€™t.</p>

<p>Good night everyone, see you soon!</p>
