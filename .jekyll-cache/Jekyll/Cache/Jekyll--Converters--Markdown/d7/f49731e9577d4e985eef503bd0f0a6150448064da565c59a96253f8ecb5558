I"¶<p>After reading <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman">Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub</a> i just understood some more about jeckyll but the truth is Iâ€™m still not sure on how URLs work in jekyll + GitHub pages and why my assets are not properly displayed in my blog, so letâ€™s try on some more research.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Adorable-animal-cat-20787.jpg" alt="A beautyfull cat" /></p>

<p>I found this image and it looks like we can store images over the internet but not in the local Repoâ€¦ well, itâ€™s not what I wanted to do but itâ€™s a start.</p>

<p>At least, Iâ€™m not so frustrated now. Easy guide following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afFb_DcBBdA">this video</a></p>

<p>Why itâ€™s now working in the GitHub Pages repo now? Date and time issues, Iâ€™m not sure to have the right configuration both in my local system and GitHub atomated datetime.</p>

<p>I may want to find a way to fix this adding a +1h to all posts. Yes, thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m in Spain soâ€¦ Not sure if this is a real fix for the problem.</p>

<p>I just found <a href="https://mehmandarov.com/jekyll-content-on-time/">this post</a> where a good explanation on how to establish Jekyll date and time zone and this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">other wiki post</a> where all the time zone options are displayed.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># set timezone
timezone: Europe/Madrid
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I just started to find warnings when adding changes to staging with git. (Iâ€™m starting to feel like a pro with git even though I only use 3 commends) Itâ€™s related to some sort of file that Jekyll is authomatically generating in the cache folder. I really donâ€™t know why this folder is there but it keeps changing a lot on every commit.</p>

<p>Well the warning is about a LF being changed to CRLF and the original line endings in my working directoryâ€¦ letâ€™s google.</p>

<p>I just found it is related to the way Unix systems treat line endings, or <strong>Line feeds</strong> -&gt; <strong>LF</strong>. Iâ€™ll just copy paste and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5834014/lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-in-git-what-is-that-and-is-it-important">reference</a> to the original onswer:</p>

<p><em>In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.</em></p>

<p><em>If you want to turn this warning off, type this in the git command line:</em></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config core.autocrlf true
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>If you want to make an intelligent decision how git should handle this, read the documentation</em></p>
