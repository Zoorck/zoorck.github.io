I"¥<p>Again late at night I just realized that I was still giving the Blog section the â€œhomeâ€ class and the â€œdefaultâ€ layout instead of the â€œpageâ€ one.</p>

<p>This was causing many troubles to fix the navigation bar at the top of the browser without covering the actual pages content. Well, Iâ€™ve set up the main page as a default layout and the other sections, as a page layout.</p>

<p>Now I want to implement a homepage that helps understanding what Iâ€™m building. I think it should really describe the three main sections I want to cover:</p>

<ul> <strong>Blog entries: </strong> The place where I'll be explaining my experience learning about programming.</ul>

<ul> <strong>"Complete" guides: </strong> A list on how to do something quite specific and limited.</ul>

<ul> <strong>Demos: </strong> Some demonstrations on what I've created in a more interactive environment (hopefully).</ul>

<p>First I have to prepare a mental map on what to build. As I have Adobe Illustrator nearby Iâ€™ll prepare a horrible first-attempt design. Okey, it doesnâ€™t even get closer to whatâ€™s on my head. Iâ€™ll try to go for the css.</p>

<p>I think itâ€™s just an other time-consuming self-teaching experience that adds no value to the web. At least I know which is not the solution:</p>

<p>Neither content-align nor marginâ€¦ But Iâ€™ll keep digging in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">css documentation</a>!</p>

<p>See you soon!</p>

<p>P.D: Something is not really working on the website when trying to have the same environment in GitHub and locallyâ€¦ behavior is not the same! Iâ€™ve had to set homepage layout back to page again to work properly on GitHub.</p>
