I"ç<p>Today Iâ€™ve decided to surrender to my inability to attach images to my posts. There is a wonderful place to visit on those situations so Iâ€™ve published the issue on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a></p>

<p>Hopefully there will be a nice wise developer who will loose some time giving me a obvious solution to this =Dâ€¦ And they did!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>![Image](http://localhost:4000/assets/images/old_look.JPG)
![Image](/assets/images/old_look.JPG)
![Image]("/assets/images/old_look.JPG")
![Image]("../assets/images/old_look.JPG")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those were my options and in the end 2 of them worked! (first and second one).</p>
