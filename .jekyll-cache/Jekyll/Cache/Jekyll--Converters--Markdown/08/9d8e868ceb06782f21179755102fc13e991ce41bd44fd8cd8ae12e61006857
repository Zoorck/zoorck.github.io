I"∞<p>First of all I‚Äôve enabled Sublime spell check, hopefully it will make me more understandable‚Ä¶</p>

<p>And now, let‚Äôs go with cayman theme. I‚Äôd like to show the before look and feel for the blog but I don‚Äôt know how to do it so I‚Äôll leave a reference here to try to show it.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/old_look.jpeg" alt="Minima look and feel" /></p>

<p>Following <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman">Cayman documentation</a> directly I‚Äôve set _config.yml to include jekyll-theme-cayman and since I would like to be able to reproduce locally the site, I‚Äôve also added a gem to my <strong>Gemfile</strong> : gem ‚Äúgithub-pages‚Äù, group: :jekyll_plugins</p>

<p>Since I‚Äôve made a modification on dependencies in the Gemfile, bundle exec command on jeckyll serve asks me to install the new gem. <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code></p>

<p>A lot of weird things on the gemfile until I used jekyll-feed version from 1.2 to 0.9 that the command-line prompt was telling me to define.</p>

<p>Now nothing works serving the files locally but it seems a problem on layouts definition. Let‚Äôs see if we can fix this. As expected we have to clone the repo locally so that everything can be tested from source files.</p>

<p>I think I changed my mind and I‚Äôll try to build layouts from my own.</p>

<p>It looks like I broke something, I‚Äôll pull my repo from GitHub! Obviously I‚Äôll have to backup this post. Well I managed to fix it on my own, just introducing a bad version of jekyll-feed.</p>

<p>Now I‚Äôll try and touch the look and feel by html and css already existing. First I‚Äôll try to install scss to sublime.</p>
