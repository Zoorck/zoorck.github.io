I"<p>First impressions are important. So I think that my web doesn’t have a good start (home page). That’s basically due to the fact that it only says “Hello world!”. I’ve managed to go from this:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/old_look2.JPG" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>to this:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/newlook2.JPG" alt="Image" /></p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a></p>

<p>Hopefully there will be a nice wise developer who will loose some time giving me a obvious solution to this =D… And they did!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>![Image](http://localhost:4000/assets/images/old_look.JPG)
![Image](/assets/images/old_look.JPG)
![Image]("/assets/images/old_look.JPG")
![Image]("../assets/images/old_look.JPG")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those were my options and in the end 2 of them worked! (first and second one).</p>

<p>Nothing more to tell about this for now. See you soon!</p>
