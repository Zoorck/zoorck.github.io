I"z<p>It looks like it was yesterday I just started this blog and now I’ve started a new project based in <a href="www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>! You can check it at <a href="zoorck.pythonanywhere.com">zoorck.pythonanywhere.com </a> with an account… which really doesn’t look like something useful for you now. Buuut, my intention here is to explain the great tool I just discovered!</p>

<p>The pythonanywhere project looks great whichever your intention on starting web development is. It includes a lot of default python tools to be able to build <strong>literally everything</strong> you want in python and have it working on-line.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div onclick="location.href='newurl.html';"&gt; content &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And I made this adaption to fulfill my interests:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="flex-child" onclick="location.href='/posts/';"&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Once the other sections start, I’ll be able to link them too. Now I’m going to try to change the cursor when hovering on top of the divs. I think it’s as easy as:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.flex-child {
	cursor: pointer;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Yes it is!</p>
