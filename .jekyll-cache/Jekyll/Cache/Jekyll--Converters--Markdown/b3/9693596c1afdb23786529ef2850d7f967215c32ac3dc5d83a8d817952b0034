I"„<p>First of all I just installed jekyll to be able to serve the web in localhost:4000 but it looks like it wonâ€™t work with the current website file content, so Iâ€™ll try to build it from scratch since I think I will be able to reuse the posts (which are almost everything I built).</p>

<p>After installing jekyll locally I thought of building my development environment in a docker container but then I felt that it would take to much time before I could actually put some stuff online so maybe Iâ€™ll be trying this latter on.</p>

<p>Wait! I just installed <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/">Sublime Merge</a> to my text editor and it actually worked for the 10th commit of my current websiteâ€¦ amazing.</p>

<p>After selecting <a href="https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman">cayman</a> as my web theme, Iâ€™ll try to open a branch, create the blog following cayman instructions and weâ€™ll see what we can then recycle from the current blog. (and how we marge with the master branch)</p>

<p>I think I created a branch called newlook and after that I started a project with default jekyll commands: jekyll new blog</p>

<p>After that I just copied all the files to the old folder to be able to run the website in localhost. And it Worked! (almost) I deleted a file and there is a post not being displayed. Iâ€™ll try to push it to the GitHub repo. Done!</p>

<p>Now Iâ€™m gonna try to attach an image demonstrating it, first, letâ€™s include this asset in assets/img.</p>

<p>Now the config file: COPY&amp;PASTE time</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>defaults:
Â  - scope:
Â  Â  Â  path: "assets/img"
Â  Â  values:
Â  Â  Â  image: true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aaaaaaandâ€¦ not working this way.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/newlook_branch.jpeg" alt="Branches image" /></p>

<p>Well, Now Iâ€™ve tried to insert and image but Iâ€™m not being able to show it on localhost, maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™ve been working on newlook branch and not in master branch. Iâ€™ll marge it and see what happens.</p>

<p>Nothing is working as expected so I think Iâ€™ll just leave it here for now.</p>

<p>See you soon.</p>
