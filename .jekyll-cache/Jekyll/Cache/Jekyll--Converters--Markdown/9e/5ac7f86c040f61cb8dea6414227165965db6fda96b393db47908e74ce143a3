I"{<p>I’m Marc Serra self-taught programmer. My goal is to feel comfortable enough to be self proclaimed a full-stack developer.  I’ve been playing with Python because of my background, I’m a physicist. Django Framework, Pandas Library, Scrappy, Numpy, … are some of my best known trip friends now.</p>

<p>I’ve also been playing around with some JS basic skills, some AWS, docker, jekyll ;), HTML, CSS, SQL, php, and some other stuff that I’ll be sharing right here in my blog and on my GitHub.</p>
