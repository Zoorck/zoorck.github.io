I")<p>Well, let’s try to use some css or scss to modify the look and feel of the website.</p>

<p>I Just were able to change page font! I’ve included the open source font to the assets/ folder and modified the main.scss inside the css folder.</p>

<p>It’s estrange that relative URL is now working properly to import the font but not with images…</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@font-face {
	font-family: "bumblebear";
	src: url("../assets/fonts/Bumblebear.otf")
}
</code></pre></div></div>
