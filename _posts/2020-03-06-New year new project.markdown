It looks like it was yesterday I just started this blog and now I've started a new project based in <a href="www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>! You can check it at <a href="zoorck.pythonanywhere.com">zoorck.pythonanywhere.com </a> with an account... which really doesn't look like something useful for you now. Buuut, my intention here is to explain the great tool I just discovered!

The pythonanywhere project looks great whichever your intention on starting web development is. It includes a lot of default python tools to be able to build <strong>literally everything</strong> you want in python and have it working on-line.

I'll bring some more info next time, now I don't have time.

See you soon!
