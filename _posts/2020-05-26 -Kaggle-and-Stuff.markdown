As a result of the COVID19 situation I've been able to play a lot after the completion of a ML course. It was really interesting to understand an overall picture of whats going on and also understand the main action to learn more, which is practice, as always!

From there I just found a great place to start! It's called <a href="https://www.kaggle.com"> kaggle </a> and it's great.

I've been playing around with some notebooks just following some internal courses they have there. I've also played a little bit with bigQuery the fact is I really enjoyed it.

I'll be practicing in there for a while and after that I will give a try to a competition to see what happens!

I've also been having some time to get into my pythonanywhere applications, I've integrated my first API with python and finally I am one step closer to be able to create my own API. I realized it doesn't make sense just right now before I learn some front end programming, my long ago course on JS it's not enough to feel comfortable managing calls between front and back end.

Now that I am writing this down it really looks like I've been learning various things! I had time to make my first steps on bootstrap and docker. Obviously there is no relation between them on the hands on practice I did but are two technologies I started using and understanding.

I am feeling again a bit lost on which should be my next steps on programming, my StartUp POC is going forward slowly but it keeps improving and also I feel like it would be possible to start making some business around my programming skills.

Not having a clear driver on my learnings makes it hard to take decisions on whats next. But I'll keep you updated.

Ohh wait! I am also doing a typing course!

As you have seen It's been a busy quarantine.
