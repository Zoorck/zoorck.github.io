First of all I just installed jekyll to be able to serve the web in localhost:4000 but it looks like it won't work with the current website file content, so I'll try to build it from scratch since I think I will be able to reuse the posts (which are almost everything I built).

After installing jekyll locally I thought of building my development environment in a docker container but then I felt that it would take to much time before I could actually put some stuff online so maybe I'll be trying this latter on.

Wait! I just installed [Sublime Merge][sublime-merge] to my text editor and it actually worked for the 10th commit of my current website... amazing.

After selecting [cayman][cayman] as my web theme, I'll try to open a branch, create the blog following cayman instructions and we'll see what we can then recycle from the current blog. (and how we marge with the master branch)
