After reading [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub][cayman] i just understood some more about jeckyll but the truth is I'm still not sure on how URLs work in jekyll + GitHub pages and why my assets are not properly displayed in my blog, so let's try on some more research.

I found this image and it looks like we can store images over the internet but not in the local Repo... well, it's not what I wanted to do but it's a start.

At least, I'm not so frustrated now. Easy guide then following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afFb_DcBBdA)

Why it's now working in the GitHub Pages repo now? Date and time issues, I'm not sure to have the right configuration both in my local system and GitHub atomated datetime.

I may want to find a way to fix this adding a +1h to all posts. Yes, thats it, I'm in Spain so...
