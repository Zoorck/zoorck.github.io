After reading [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub][cayman] i just understood some more about jeckyll but the truth is I'm still not sure on how URLs work in jekyll + GitHub pages and why my assets are not properly displayed in my blog, so let's try on some more research.

I found this image and it looks like we can store images over the internet but not in the local Repo... well, it's not what I wanted to do but it's a start.

At least, I'm not so frustrated now. Easy guide then following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afFb_DcBBdA)

Why it's now working in the GitHub Pages repo now?
