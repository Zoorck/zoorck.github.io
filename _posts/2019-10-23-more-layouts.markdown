Again late at night I just realized that I was still giving the Blog section the "home" class and the "default" layout instead of the "page" one.

This was causing many troubles to fix the navigation bar at the top of the browser without covering the actual pages content. Well, I've set up the main page as a default layout and the other sections, as a page layout.

Now I want to implement a homepage that helps understanding what I'm building. I think it should really describe the three main sections I want to cover:

<ul> <strong>Blog entries: </strong> The place where I'll be explaining my experience learning about programming.</ul>

<ul> <strong>"Complete" guides: </strong> A list on how to do something quite specific and limited.</ul>

<ul> <strong>Demos: </strong> Some demonstrations on what I've created in a more interactive environment (hopefully).</ul>

First I have to prepare a mental map on what to build. As I have Adobe Illustrator nearby I'll prepare a horrible first-attempt design. Okey, it doesn't even get closer to what's on my head. I'll try to go for the css.

I think it's just an other time-consuming self-teaching experience that adds no value to the web. At least I know which is not the solution:

Neither content-align nor margin... But I'll keep digging in the [css documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)!

See you soon!

P.D: Something is not really working on the website when trying to have the same environment in GitHub and locally... behavior is not the same! I've had to set homepage layout back to page again to work properly on GitHub.
