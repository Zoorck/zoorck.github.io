First of all I've enabled Sublime spell check, hopefully it will make me more understandable...

And now, let's go with cayman theme. I'd like to show the before look and feel for the blog but I don't know how to do it so I'll leave a reference here to try to show it.

Following [Cayman documentation](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) directly I've set \_config.yml to include jekyll-theme-cayman and since I would like to be able to reproduce locally the site, I've also added a gem to my **Gemfile** : gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

Since I've made a modification on dependencies in the Gemfile, bundle exec command on jeckyll serve asks me to install the new gem. `bundle install` 

A lot of weird things on the gemfile until I used jekyll-feed version from 1.2 to 0.9 that the command-line prompt was telling me to define.

Now nothing works serving the files locally but it seems a problem on layouts definition. Let's see if we can fix this. As expected we have to clone the repo locally so that everything can be tested from source files.

I think I changed my mind and I'll try to build layouts from my own.

It looks like I broke something, I'll pull my repo from GitHub! Obviously I'll have to backup this post. Well I managed to fix it on my own, just introducing a bad version of jekyll-feed.
