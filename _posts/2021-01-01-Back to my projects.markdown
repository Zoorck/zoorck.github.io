Again it looks that I have abandoned my entries a little bit and it is true. But a lot has happened since then!

To start, I was able to upload a full django project to pythonanywhere and it was great. It is possible to keep it uploaded there for free if i keep asking for a 3 month period. It's been a great tool to be able to focus on functionality and not on the OPS part. I was able to offer a simple web to do an online cohort analysis.

After that I also managed to integrate an API to a second application I built under the same app. A payments API, it was about my current work: <a href="https://easypaymentgateway.com">Easy Payment Gateway</a> on a javascript fashion. It was fun to start from a work related topic.

Some time after that I discovered a great resource named <a href="https://testdriven.io/"> Test Driven </a> which ofers real world examples on how to develop certain applications. Thanks to this 3 part guide: <a href="https://testdriven.io/blog/dockerizing-django-with-postgres-gunicorn-and-nginx/"> Dockerizing Django with Postgres, Gunicorn, and Nginx. </a> I have been able to upload a full dokerized project to aws and I also took it down the same week since there was no immediate usage of it so it was a expense with no clear return.

I was really happy to achieve this last result, it was a fully working website under zoorck.com domain with ssl certificate expelled by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">let's encrypt</a> and a managed database.

It has been a while since I did it and after that i focused in learning some new frontend tools, starting with an Angular course. I Just managed to start it and do the basics but it is not yet something I can easily use. I will keep some repositories with angular small projects which are part of the course.

Now I am looking forward to develop my skills in various areas:

* Adobe XD
* Angular
* Fast API 
* Kubernetes
* Terraform
* Elastic Stack

As you may have noticed the first 3 are the ones that I hope to establish as my application design stack. My front end capabilities are absolutely null now and I really hope to make a huge difference once this all is learned!

I am following several udemy courses to learn all of this but I just need to keep away from The Whitcher - Wild Hunt and Netflix ... hopefully I will!

I have also found that my work has been mostly on backend so none of it is easily sharable, and this implies a bad portfolio. I will make some effort to give a more attractive look and feel for my projects!
