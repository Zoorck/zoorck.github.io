Well, let's try to use some css or scss to modify the look and feel of the website.

I Just were able to change page font! I've included the open source font to the assets/ folder and modified the main.scss inside the css folder.

It's estrange that relative URL is now working properly to import the font but not with images...

```
@font-face {
	font-family: "bumblebear";
	src: url("../assets/fonts/Bumblebear.otf")
}
```
