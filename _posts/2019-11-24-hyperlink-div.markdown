First impressions are important. So I think that my web doesn't have a good start (home page). That's basically due to the fact that it only says "Hello world!". I've managed to go from this:

![Old look homepage]({{ "/assets/images/old_look2.JPG" | absolute_url }})

to this:

![New look homepage]({{ "/assets/images/newlook2.JPG" | absolute_url }})


Thanks to [this](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-mountains-under-cloudy-sky-3022417/)! So thank you very much [Tomáš Malčo](https://www.pexels.com/@tomas-malco-malik-793526)

And also had to work out some css like this small trim:

![Banner css example]({{ "/assets/images/banner_css.JPG" | absolute_url }})

It looks like .jpg is key sensitive when related to a css img file but not in a blog... sounds quite weird to me but it is working now and it wasn't.

Good night everyone, see you soon!

I've managed to center "automatically" the banner text in the main page! You can check the changes from the image above:

![New banner css]({{ "/assets/images/banner_flexbox.JPG" | absolute_url }})
